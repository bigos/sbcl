** Notes
In this method:
file:./src/pcl/init.lisp::133

we have
[[file:./src/pcl/init.lisp::when (and typep (not t))]]

That needs further investigation to see if we can have type checking at the make-
instance stage.

checking initargs values, I may need to check for the presence of required arguments here

** Warnings or errors

We may not have strict errors like in Haskell, but is there a chance for
reasonable hints when dealing with object initialisation?
